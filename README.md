# Number Guessing

Set a number before starting a game.

In each round, your mobile phone will guess the number and you have to tell it whether the number is larger than or smaller than the current guess. If you select the wrong direction, an alert will be displayed and you have to select the direction again.

At the end of the game, the number of rounds and the number set will be shown on the screen and you can start a new game.
